This is a [Aubay Hackathon](https://www.aubay.pt/) using next.js and typescript to emulate how our frontend would look like after integrating with backend.
## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
